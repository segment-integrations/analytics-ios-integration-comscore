 <b>Configuring the library as a publisher</b>
 
 For publishers prior to sending any measurement the Analytics class needs to be configured. To do
 this we need to following steps:
 
 <ol>
 <li> Set up the publisher configuration using the SCORPublisherConfiguration class</li>
 <li> Add the PublisherConfiguration to the Configuration</li>
 <li> Start the library</li>
 </ol>
 
 The following code shows how to follow these steps:
 
    @code
     SCORPublisherConfiguration  publisherConfiguration =
     [SCORPublisherConfiguration publisherConfigurationWithBuilderBlock:^(SCORPublisherConfigurationBuilder  builder) {
        builder.publisherId = @"your_comscore_publisher_id";
        builder.publisherSecret = @"your_comscore_publisher_secret";
        builder.vce = NO;
        builder.liveTransmissionMode = SCORLiveTransmissionModeLan;
     }];
 
     [[SCORAnalytics configuration] addPublisherWithConfiguration:publisherConfiguration];
     
     [SCORAnalytics start]; // Start the SDK asynchronously
    @endcode
 
 <b>Configuring the library as a partner</b>
 
 To configure the library as a partner follow the next steps:
 
 <ol>
 <li> Set up the partner configuration using the SCORPartnerConfiguration class</li>
 <li> Add the PartnerConfiguration to the Configuration</li>
 <li> Start the library</li>
 </ol>
 
 The following code shows how to follow these steps:
 
    @code
     // Always give the option to the publishers to initialize themselves the ComScore configuration
     SCORPartnerConfiguration  partnerConfiguration =
     [SCORPartnerConfiguration partnerConfigurationWithBuilderBlock:^(SCORPartnerConfigurationBuilder  builder) {
        builder.partnerId = @"your_comscore_partner_id";
        builder.externalClientId = @"your_external_client_id";
        builder.vce = NO;
        builder.liveTransmissionMode = SCORLiveTransmissionModeLan;
     }];
 
 
     [SCORAnalytics start];
    @endcode
